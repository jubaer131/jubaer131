Hi, I’m @jubaer ahmed


👀 I’m interested in web development, AI technology, and open-source projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js and Next.js to build powerful and efficient web applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage React.js and Next.js for innovative solutions.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send me a message here on GitHub or reach out via email at jubayerahmad131@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I have a strong interest in hiking and aspire to conquer mountains in the near future.
